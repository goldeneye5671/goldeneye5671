## About Me
  Programming has been a passion of mine ever since I received my first computer from my dad many years ago. Over the years I have done many things to learn how to code, such as taking programming courses throughout my high school years, going to college for computer science for a few semesters, and going to the App Academy coding bootcamp. I have made several projects along the way and have learned many technologies, some within the span of a few weeks, and had to use those technologies to make amazing projects with a quick turnaround time. I have enjoyed my time learning and now want to spend my time doing, with some learning along the way
